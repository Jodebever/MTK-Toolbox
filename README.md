## üí° Usage

Follow these steps to generate your own TWRP build:

- **Step 1**: Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
- **Step 2**: Use a tool like `bootimg` to unpack your `recovery.img`.  
  Edit `default.prop` or `prop.default` by appending this line at the bottom:  
  `ro.product.first_api_level=(your Android SDK version)`  
  Then repack the recovery.
- **Step 3**: Upload the repacked `recovery.img` to your forked repo and copy its direct link.
- **Step 4**: Go to the **Actions** tab in your repo, and start a new workflow run.  
  Paste the direct link and specify the desired TWRP version.
- **Step 5**: Hit **Run workflow** and let the system build your TWRP image.
